## ðŸ§  Model

- Trained on the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data), based on the MNIST dataset.
- Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with **Keras** and **TensorFlow**.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Flask** â€“ for the backend and routing
- **TensorFlow / Keras** â€“ for training and running the digit classifier
- **OpenCV** â€“ to process the userâ€™s drawing before prediction
- **Matplotlib** â€“ to generate a probability graph of predictions
